# twitter_reply_generator

This is the source code used to generate the twitter_reply_generator model.

The model is hosted here : https://huggingface.co/marca116/twitter_reply_generator

To generate a reply, first write a tweet in the textarea. Then, add {REPLY} at the end.

Alternatively, you can use the HuggingFace space to generate a tweet. In that case, you don't need to add {REPLY} at the end of the tweet.
